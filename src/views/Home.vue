          We all know that having too much sugar is bad for your health. However, food corporations have been pouring
          sugar into their products since it not only improves the taste, but it is also highly addictive. Moreover, to
          cover up the high sugar content, companies came up with numerous advertising strategies to "package" these sugar
          without the consumers noticing. This study aims to explore the complicate relationship between sugar and how it
          is represented in the media.
