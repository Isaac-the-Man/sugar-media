        <h3>Advertising Tactics</h3>
        <p>
          Let's explore how the food and beverage industry utilizes deceptive marketing strategies ot encourage people
          to eat even more sugar. We'll be looking at the three most common methods listed below:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Re-Marketing</li>
          <li>Healthy Wording</li>
          <li>PR Campaigns</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The targeted audience of these commercials are mostly children, women, and minorities. The below points
          summarizes the reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sugars are more addictive to children</li>
          <li>Children are vulnerable to persuasion</li>
          <li>Women are targeted as "Food Decision Makers"</li>
          <li>TV shows aimed at minorities tends to have a much higher proportion of sugary ads.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Re-Marketing</h4>
        <p>
          Re-Marketing refers to the strategy that takes an existing sugar-light or even sugar-free brand, and create a
          sweeter version of the product under the same name. This tactic is popular especially in cereal brands since
          cereal are generally viewed as "healthy" for most customers. The presence of sugar benefit's from the
          consumer's perception of the healthiness of the originals. These new "flavors" can sometimes have 10 times the
          amount of sugar compared to its original.

        <p>
          The original <i>Cheerios</i>, for example, contains only 1 gram of sugar per serving. The re-marketed flavor
          "Apple Cinnamon", however, has 10 gram of sugar! Although not as exaggerated, the brand <i>Chex</i> as well as
          <i>Special
            K</i> also contains multifolds of sugar compared to its original.

        <h4>"Healthy" Wording</h4>
        <p>
          As the name suggests, this strategy uses keywords that are positively associated with health to market the
          product, despite not adding any real meaning. Some examples of these are "Fruits", "Natural", "Original", and
          "Energy".
        </p>
        <p>
          Take <i>VitaminWater</i> for example. It is essentially a drink with sugar comparable to that of a
          soda, but it is marketed as a healthy beverage with health buzzwords such as "Vitamin", "Defense", and
          "Energy", words that that makes absolutely no sense. Even worse, most of its flavor, like this "Endurance
          Peach Mango" has only 0~1 percent of real juice. Not to mention how is it related to "Endurance".

        </div>
        <p>
          Another infamous case is the <i>Fruit-Rollups</i>, which the company claim is a "fruit snack" while three out
          of five of its ingredients are basically sugars. It was even false-advertised as a nutritious snack made with
          real fruit. Pressure of lawsuit eventually forced the company to re-label the product.

        <h4>PR Campaigns</h4>
        <p>
          Sugar interests have tried, through sophisticated advertising and marketing strategies, to obscure the link
          between the consumption of added sugar and adverse health consequences. One of this strategy is to hire PR
          agencies to
          un-associate the relation between the two.

        <p>
          In 2009, the CRA paid the PR firm Berman and Company to create deceptive TV and print ads promoting the
          “naturalness” of high-fructose corn syrup. The ads were aimed at consumers concerned about eating excess sugar
          in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, encouraging them to disbelieve information from scientific experts
          that eating sugar in any form had negative health outcomes. The CRA even tried to hide its sponsorship of the
          program by running the campaign through the Center of Consumer Freedom. Basically, the CRA wanted to promote
          the messages that all added sugars were “natural” and that the quantities that Americans should eat was a
          matter of consumer freedom—messages contrary to scientific evidence linking sugar to metabolic diseases and to
          the recommendations to limit sugar intake by major public health organizations.
